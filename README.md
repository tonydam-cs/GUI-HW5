# GUI-HW5

An interactive dynamic table is created and interacted by the user for inputs. The user is able to have 4 inputs,
minimum column value, maximum column value, minimum column value, and maximum column value. When entered a table 
is created starting with the user's minimum input for the row/ horizontal axis and ending with the user's max input. 
The same is done for the column/ vertical axis of the table. Afterwards the table will multiply the values of the
row and column values that are aligned (including the number in between) in order to create a multiplication table.

The program also checks for user input where if they enter nothing in any of the boxes it'll display an error.
The program swaps min and max values if the min value is greater than the max, while also displaying a caution
that the action has been made.
